The Package BillingSystem contains 5 files

*INTRODUCTION*
I have a designed an Electronics Store Billing System.It can be used by an electronics store to calculate the total amount and obtain the receipt for a particular order.It can be used for small orders i.e for one customer who might be buying 1 television as well as for large orders given by hotels and institutions for huge number of items. 

*CONCEPTS AND  ECLIPSE COMPONENTS USED*
I have used WindowBuilder to make the Application window which made my job a whole lot easier.WindowBuilder is composed of SWT Designer and Swing Designer and makes it very easy to create Java GUI applications without spending a lot of time writing it.
To create the billing system window,I have used the window builder which allowed me to drag and drop the text fields,check boxes,labels.

The concepts illustarted in this project are :

1.Abstraction- Classes.
2.Scope and Lifetime of variables.
3.Declaring objects.
4.Instance Variables of different data types.
5.Constructors/Methods.
6.'this' keyword.
7.Inheritance.
8.Overriding.
9.Access control mechanism.
10.Packages.
11.Interfaces.
12.Exception Handling.
13.Creation of thread to execute a certain process.
14.Few string handling mechanisms 

The Billing window contains:
1.The name of each item along with its unit price.
2.The text field for each product to enter the quantity.
3.Alphabetical characters cannot be entered in the text field
4.There are 4 buttons-
-Total=> Displays the sub total,GST,total of all the items and displays it in the text boxes placed in front of their labels.
-Receipt=>Displays the total Receipt in the blank space on the right side
-Reset=>Resets all the text field.
-Exit=>Exit from the application 
5.Discount: The area contains check boxes for various percentages of discount.If the checkbox is checked in front of 10%, the total will be calculated after a 10% reduction.
